# 🌾 Sugarcane Production Data Analysis

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on sugarcane production data to extract meaningful insights about production trends, regional variations, and year-wise growth patterns. The analysis is aimed at supporting better decision-making in agricultural planning and resource allocation.
